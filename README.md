## About the PunchcardAPI project

This api is a school project for a course in Web Services at the University of Reykjavík (autumn 2016).

The project's description is as follows:
The API will be used as a foundation for a new service called "punchcard.com", where both companies and their users can register, and users can then issue a "punch". When they've collected enough punches (usually 10), they will get a discount at the company (perhaps a free meal at a restaurant after buying 10 meals, or 20% discount of their next purchase at some shop etc.).

* npm install

And then use a browser or some other tool to use the api
